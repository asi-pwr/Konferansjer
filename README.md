# Konferansjer

Konferansjer is a tool made for use with [Open Broadcaster Software][obs]. It's designed for creating and managing overlays such as animated logos, titlebars and slideshows, that are independent from scene switching. 

### Why do I need such tool? 
We are using OBS to live stream (not only) conference called [Linux Session][sesja]. OBS scene-system is not optimized for such task - our typical configuration consist of a few scenes, each having different camera setup. We needed a tool to create title bars (i belive that proper term is [Lower Third][lth] ) that can be created on-fly and are independent from switching cameras. 

### Authors
Konferansjer was created by two members of [Academic IT Association][asi] on [Wroclaw University of Technology][pwr]: [Kajetan Krykwiñski][kk] and [Adam Rogowski][ar]

### Current status
As tool was used only internally, for initial commit most things are hardcoded and much documentation is missing. We hope to fix this in near future.
